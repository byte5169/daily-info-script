# daily-info-script

A project/simple script that should inform me/my family on the basic info in the morning.

Info:
- weather now and expected during the day
- duration of daylight hours, start and finish
- bitcoin/ether/etc current value
- currency conversion rate (BYN - USD, BYN -EUR)
- Google Calendar for today
- random easy breakfast recipe 
- some more ideas??? 

For project telegram-bot is used to notify. 
The first iteration will run on my raspberry pi, then will migrate to AWS to train that aspect.
